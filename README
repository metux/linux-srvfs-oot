2DO:
    * locking:
        * yet completely untested
        * needs deeper revision, just returning 0 on unimplemented fops
          might not be enough, seems there's a generic implementation
          we need to call instead
        * see various functions in fs/lock.c
        * what does is_remote_lock() do ?
